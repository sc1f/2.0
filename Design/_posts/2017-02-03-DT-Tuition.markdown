I built Sketch mockups of a project for *the Daily Texan*'s technical operations department. We wanted to explore the data on how UT-Austin used tuition funds, and how each student's tuition was distributed to different causes.

In the design process, I was really inspired by the Texas Tribune's use of infographics in *[Unholstered](https://apps.texastribune.org/unholstered/)*, where each square represented one shooting. I wanted to have the same effect, with each square representing $1 (or whatever evenly denominated portion) of a single student's tuition. We would then break down and color code the data as we guide the viewers through the way their money is being used.

Unfortunately, this project is still stuck in the exploratory stage while we wait on data from the university, but I'd like to see it through to completion.
