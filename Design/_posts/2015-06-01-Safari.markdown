_As the Editor-in-Chief, I had a principal role in deciding the visual language and creative direction of the 2015 yearbook. As a staff, we chose "Decode" as a theme in order to portray the idea of one's high school experience as an evolving enigma, revealed over time. Though I was solely responsible for the page designs displayed here, the book is a culmination of effort by myself and the staff members._<br><br>
