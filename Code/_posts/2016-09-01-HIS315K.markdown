Using mockups I made as part of LAITS, I coded the entire front-end (in AngularJS and Angular material) for the online learning management system, built multiple backend and integrated features, and continue to perform maintenance and build features for the platform to this day.

The platform consists of a front-end assignment view as well as a fully interactive content management and editorial system that is flexible, scalable, and adaptable to the user's needs.

This is an ongoing project - I am deeply involved in the development process on both the backend and frontend, and am currently scaling and developing the platform for extensive use cases.
